* The Path Visualization is based on we will be given a graph we find a path by giving a src and a destination as an input which gives us the visualization of single path which will be seen we can modify it for all possible paths using DFS.
* Depth Limited Search it is similar to DFS but we will be iterating to a particular depth alone to check if the destination can be reached at the given depth which is given by the user.
